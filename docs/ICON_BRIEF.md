# Fastener Icon Illustration Brief

Commission ~44 monochrome silhouette illustrations for fasteners.fyi.
Each illustration represents a distinct fastener shape (many individual fastener types share the same silhouette).

## Deliverables

- **Format:** SVG, single `<svg>` element per shape
- **Color:** Monochrome. Stroke in `currentColor`, inner detail fill in a single muted accent color (will be mapped to CSS variable)
- **Style:** Clean technical silhouette. Not photorealistic, not cartoonish. Think McMaster-Carr catalog line drawings.
- **Orientation:** Profile/side view. Fastener pointing down (threaded end at bottom) for screws/bolts. Top-down for washers. Side profile for nuts.
- **Thread indication:** Simplified. 3-4 angled lines suggesting thread pitch, not exact thread count.
- **Stroke weight:** Uniform 1.5-2px at reference size
- **ViewBox:** Standardized per category (see below)
- **No text, no labels, no dimensions** inside the SVG

## Notes for the Illustrator

1. **Consistency matters more than detail.** All 44 shapes should feel like they belong to the same family: same stroke weight, same level of simplification, same viewing angle within each category.

2. **McMaster-Carr pages** show technical line drawings alongside product listings. These are the gold standard for shape accuracy. You may need to create a free account to view full catalog imagery.

3. **Grainger pages** show actual product photographs. Use these to verify proportions and real-world appearance, but don't try to replicate photographic detail.

4. **Thread simplification:** Use 3-4 angled parallel lines to suggest threading. Don't draw individual threads.

5. **Shared shapes:** Some shape keys appear in multiple categories (e.g., bolt-hanger and screw-hanger are the same object; anchor-tnut and nut-t are the same object). Only one illustration is needed per unique shape; the code handles the mapping.

6. **Priority order:** If doing this in batches, start with the most common shapes:
   - **Batch 1 (highest traffic):** screw-flat, screw-pan, bolt-hex, bolt-carriage, nut-hex, nut-lock, washer-flat, washer-split, anchor-wedge, anchor-plastic
   - **Batch 2:** screw-socket, screw-button, screw-hex-washer, bolt-lag, bolt-eye, bolt-u, nut-wing, nut-acorn, nut-flange, anchor-toggle, anchor-molly
   - **Batch 3:** Everything else
