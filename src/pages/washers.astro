          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">Do I always need a washer with a bolt?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Not always, but washers are recommended in most applications. They distribute the clamping load over a larger area, prevent surface damage, and provide a consistent bearing surface for the nut or bolt head. Washers are especially important on soft materials (wood, aluminum, plastic) where the fastener head could pull through or crush the surface.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What is the difference between a flat washer and a fender washer?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Fender washers have a much larger outer diameter relative to the hole size compared to standard flat washers. This extra surface area spreads the load over a wider area, making them ideal for thin or soft materials where a standard washer might pull through. They are commonly used in automotive body panels, sheet metal, and drywall applications.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">Do lock washers actually prevent loosening?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Split lock washers (helical spring washers) are the most common type, but testing by the Junker vibration test shows they provide minimal anti-loosening benefit compared to a properly torqued plain washer. For reliable vibration resistance, Nord-Lock wedge-locking washers, thread-locking adhesive, or prevailing torque nuts are more effective solutions.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What size washer do I need for a given bolt?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Washer sizing is based on the bolt diameter. The washer's inner diameter should be slightly larger than the bolt shank — typically 1/16" larger for imperial sizes. For example, a 1/2" bolt uses a washer with a 9/16" inner diameter. Standard washer outer diameters and thicknesses are defined by SAE (narrow) and USS (wide) specifications for imperial, and ISO 7089/7093 for metric.</div>

          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Belleville washers (conical spring washers) maintain tension in a bolted joint by acting as a spring. They compensate for thermal expansion, settling, and relaxation of the clamped materials. Use them in applications requiring consistent clamping force over time — such as flanged pipe connections, electrical connections, and high-temperature assemblies where differential expansion occurs.</div>
