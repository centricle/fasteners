          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Grade markings on bolt heads indicate tensile strength. Grade 2 (no marks) is standard low-carbon steel. Grade 5 (three radial lines) is medium-carbon quenched and tempered steel with 120,000 PSI tensile strength. Grade 8 (six radial lines) is high-strength alloy steel at 150,000 PSI. Metric bolts use a numerical system (e.g., 8.8, 10.9, 12.9).</div>

          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Carriage bolts have a smooth, dome-shaped head with a square shoulder beneath that locks into the wood to prevent spinning. They are used when a finished appearance is needed or when the bolt head should not be removable with a wrench. Hex bolts are tightened from the head side with a wrench and are used in structural and mechanical applications where higher torque is required.</div>

          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Coarse thread (UNC) bolts have fewer threads per inch, are more resistant to cross-threading, and are standard for general-purpose use. Fine thread (UNF) bolts have more threads per inch, providing higher tensile strength and better resistance to vibration loosening. Fine threads are common in automotive and aerospace applications.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">How do I measure bolt length?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Bolt length is measured from the bearing surface (underside of the head) to the end of the shank. For hex bolts and most standard bolts, this means the head is not included in the length. Exceptions include countersunk bolts (e.g., flat head), where length is measured from the top of the head since it sits flush with the surface.</div>
