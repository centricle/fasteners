          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What is the difference between wood screws and machine screws?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Wood screws have a tapered shank with coarse threads designed to cut into wood fibers. Machine screws have a uniform diameter with finer threads and require a pre-tapped hole or nut. Wood screws are self-tapping in wood; machine screws are used in metal, plastic, or other materials with matching threaded holes.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What does the screw gauge number mean?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Screw gauge refers to the diameter of the screw shaft. Common gauges range from #2 (0.086") to #14 (0.242"). Higher numbers indicate larger diameters. For screws 1/4" and above, the diameter is stated as a fraction rather than a gauge number.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">When should I use self-tapping vs self-drilling screws?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Self-tapping screws create their own threads in a pre-drilled pilot hole. Self-drilling screws have a drill-bit tip that eliminates the need for a pilot hole entirely. Use self-tapping screws in softer materials like wood or plastic. Use self-drilling screws for sheet metal or steel framing where drilling and fastening in one step saves time.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What drive type is strongest: Phillips, Torx, or Robertson?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Robertson (square) and Torx (star) drives resist cam-out better than Phillips, allowing more torque transfer. Torx provides the highest torque capacity due to its six-lobe contact area. Phillips was intentionally designed to cam out at a set torque to prevent over-tightening, which is a disadvantage when maximum clamping force is needed.</div>

          <summary class="px-6 py-4 cursor-pointer text-lg font-medium hover:text-accent-400 transition-colors">What screw material should I use outdoors?</summary>
          <div class="px-6 pb-4 text-bp-text-muted">Stainless steel (304 or 316) resists corrosion in most outdoor environments. For pressure-treated lumber, use screws rated ACQ-compatible — typically stainless steel or specially coated screws. Avoid plain steel or zinc-plated screws outdoors, as they corrode rapidly. Silicon bronze is preferred for marine applications.</div>
