          M6 or 1/4-20? Every trip to the hardware store starts with the same question. Metric or imperial, thread pitch, head type, grade — the specs exist in manufacturer catalogs, but good luck finding them when you're standing in the fastener aisle trying to match a bolt.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg" style="color: var(--bp-text); opacity: 0.8;">
          I built fasteners.fyi so the answer is one search away. Every fastener type, every spec, sourced from manufacturer datasheets and industry standards.

      <!-- What it does -->

      <p class="text-bp-text-muted mb-10">
        fasteners.fyi is a specification database for screws, bolts, anchors, nuts, and washers. Look up any fastener type and get dimensions, thread specs, strength grades, and material options. No opinions — just reliable technical data.
